Parking Management System

The Parking Management System is a Java application designed to automate basic parking tasks
and illustrate fundamental software design principles such as Object-Oriented Programming,
Layered Design, and the usage of databases.

This prototype provides a solution to the needs of data management in infrastructure systems.
In contrast to commercial systems, this prototype gives a higher priority to clean architectural
design and organization rather than unnecessary functionality.

This application is built with Java and uses a layered design, isolating controllers,
data access layers, models, and interfaces, making it highly readable, maintainable, and scalable.
User login security is implemented to safeguard functionality, with PostgreSQL serving to store data through JDBC.
