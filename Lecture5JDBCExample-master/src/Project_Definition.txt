Parking Management System

“Parking Management System” is a console application programmed by using Java
to show how parking can be implemented as an example of object-oriented programming.
This application is an educational model, giving more importance to a well-structured
and layered architecture rather than an involved interface.

User authentication is a key module, which handles system functionalities using
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Based on the role provided by the database,
users are directed to access either a customized admin interface, handled by
the AdminRep class, or a general interface.

All the data concerning users and parking areas is stored within a PostgreSQL database.
The process of communication is implemented via the JDBC library. This project
illustrates how infrastructure management software can also incorporate proper software
design principles such as abstraction.
