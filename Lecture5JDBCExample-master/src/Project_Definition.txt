Parking Management System is a Java console application
for managing parking spot rentals in a small parking area.
The system uses PostgreSQL (via JDBC) to store users, parking spots,
and parking orders. Users can register or log in, view their
active parking zone, see all free parking zones, and rent a spot
for 1, 3, or 6 months with fixed pricing (200$, 550$, 1000$) or buy
a spot forever (5000$). The application validates input (phone number
length 11, car number length 8) and prevents renting an already occupied spot.
An admin account can view the full parking status: all spots, current owner,
rental status, and end date (or “FOREVER” for permanent purchases).
he project demonstrates layered architecture (models, repositories, interfaces),
basic authentication, and database-driven CRUD operations.
