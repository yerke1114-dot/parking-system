“Parking Management System” is a console application in Java that
has been developed in order to implement simple parking system
functionality as a representation of key computer programming principles
such as Object-Oriented Programming.

The project undertaken is an educational prototype. The priority is clean
architectural design and logic structure over complex commercial-level functionality.
The structure of the app is readable, maintainable, and easily modifiable.

User authentication is also implemented to manage access to different
features in the system. All data pertaining to the user and the parking
zone is also stored in a PostgreSQL database using JDBC.
The project also demonstrates how infrastructure management applications
can be designed using well-structured principles in computer software.
